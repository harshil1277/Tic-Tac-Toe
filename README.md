# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game developed in Java Script

##RULES
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O. It is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player's goal is to make 3 in a row.

Typically, X starts first, but in Gametable's Tabletop Tic Tac Toe, Player 1 starts first on the first game and Player 2 (or the computer) starts first on the next game. The starting player continues to alternate from game to game. This helps keep gameplay fair over time.

Players take turns placing their Mark, X or O, on an open square in the grid. The first player to make 3 of their own mark in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is considered a Tie.

The expert artificial intelligence (AI) will play a perfect game. Try your best to Tie it for as long as you can!

##ZERO-SUM GAME
Tic-Tac-Toe is a zero-sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, the game will end in a Tie. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple strategies, then you'll be able to not only play, but to win the majority of the time.

##HISTORY
Tic-Tac-Toe is a long beloved classic pen and paper or board game for two players. Variations of Tic Tac Toe have been played since the Roman Empire and 3 in a row games can be traced all the way back to ancient Egypt!
