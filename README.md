# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game developed in Java Script

## RULES
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O. It is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player's goal is to make 3 in a row.

O starts first, but in Gametable's Tabletop Tic Tac Toe, Player 1 starts first on the first game and Player 2 starts first on the next game. The starting player continues to alternate from game to game. This helps keep gameplay fair over time.

Players take turns placing their Mark, X or O, on an open square in the grid. The first player to make 3 of their own mark in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is considered a Tie.
